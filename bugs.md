1. Relationship sections shows all people even when in different locations. While in school, I should only be able to see people related to school. Same with Other locations. People should also show up at home if the relationship is high.
2. Return home shouldn't cost any time. Otherwise, the user can get stuck in another location and run out of usable time.
3. The career actions don't filter out actions based on what is possible. It shows options even when the user doesn't have the time to do them
4. I can scroll even when one of the menus is open. The menu scrolls down with the events. I should have to close the menu
5. The top of the menu can go out of view if the contents are long. I have to scroll up to bring it back in view. The information at the top of the menu should be visible always when the menu is opened. The choices should be scrollable, if there are too many to fit.
6. It lists all of the options in the menu even when they are not relevant.

  Education & Career
  Education: High School | GPA 2.50 | Bar: Not Licensed
  Career: Trainee ($24,000/yr, Perf 85%) | Law Exp: 0y | Licensed Exp: 0y
  Wrestling: FACE | Momentum 53 | Push 36 | Fanbase 40 | Promo 76 | Injury Years 0
  Shadow Career: Dormant

I shouldn't see all these information. Education is not relevant if I am not currently enrolled in any education. Shadow Career shouldn't be visible if I don't have that active. 

The information should also be displayed in a more readable format. Right now, it looks like a mess when it shows it in multi line.

7. For Popularity related careers like Wrestling, it should also show a Popularity bar below the other stat bars.
8. In wrestling, you should have to sign a contract for certain years. Once the contract ends, you can either neogitate a new contract or leave. It should also be possible for rival promotions to offer you new contracts. If you decide to leave you can either work the indie circuit or try to find a job backstage or any other job.
9. I shouldn't be able to advance age until I am back home
10. Plot to kill doesn't seem to do anything. It keeps giving the same option no matter how many times I have already clicked it.
11. People in relations doesn't change when I am at a different promotion in Wreslting.
12. I can still go to school even when not enrolled
13. I keep seeing the green dot to show new action available, but I don't see any new action. Also ensure that it also highlights the specific thing that is new. In relatinoships, it should also highlight the new action. That highlight should be gone once the user sees it. If that same action is available with multiple people in relations, seeing one should be enough.
14. As I get promoted to higher roles in the job, the people who are coworkers or under me, I should be able to influence their career.
