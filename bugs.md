1. The Career tab lists many options making it messy and hard to navigate. Group all options under the main category that they are related to like: wresltin, politics, etc
2. When there are new options, the highlights don't go away when the user sees it. User needs to click on one of the actions for it to go away. This is undesirable. 
3. For each career, the user should do "go to ..." option before they can do activities related to it. like: "Go to Arena" for wreslting, "Go to court" for judge, "Go to office" for politics, etc
4. The display should fit on the screen. It should completely fit, scrolling is fine in menu, but the overall structure of the app should fit both heigh and width.
